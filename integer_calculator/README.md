# Integer Calculator with Postfix Notation

This project implements a simple integer calculator using postfix notation (Reverse Polish notation) to handle operator precedence, functions, and parentheses.

Implemented Features:
 - basic arithmetic (\+, \-, \*, \/ with integer division)
 - conditional (IF(a, b, c)) and unary negation (N a)
 - MIN(...) and MAX(...) functions with unlimited arguments
 - parentheses for grouping
 - division by zero detection

Input Format
 - n â€“ number of expressions
 - n expressions in infix notation, ending with '.' and separated by spaces

Output Format
 - the expression converted to postfix notation
 - step-by-step execution log, displaying the operator/function and stack content
 - the final result

 Test files have been provided to verify correctness.
